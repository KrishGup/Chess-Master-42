- **Information Overload**: Too many strategies and tactics make it difficult to know where to start.
- **Lack of Personalized Guidance**: Generic tutorials don’t adapt to a player’s unique weaknesses.
- **Difficulty in Analyzing Mistakes**: Beginners often struggle to understand where they went wrong and how to improve.
- **Limited Interactive Learning**: Most chess training platforms focus on passive learning rather than active engagement.
